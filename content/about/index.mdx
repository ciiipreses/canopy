# About

The Ciiipreses project is informed by art historical, conservation, and scientific research to explore materials and working methods used to produce richly illuminated manuscripts in 15th-century Seville. Organized around 13 initials in the Rosenwald Collection at the National Gallery of Art attributed to the [Master of the Cypresses](https://www.nga.gov/collection/artist-info.4668.html), the first phase of this project has located and partially reconstructed the original context of the known cuttings and other fragments from the San Isidoro choir books.

Future directions for study of the materials used by painter-illuminators active in late medieval and early modern Seville look to analytical methods to generate pigment maps that visualize the various layers and mixtures employed by groups of artists in a workshop. This includes chemical imaging and point-based spectroscopic techniques for noninvasive material identification, combined with machine learning techniques. This research aims to produce new knowledge on the selection and application of materials during the creation of choir books and new data for art historians to reimagine working relationships among scribes, painters, and bookmakers. The aggregate findings will offer a more contextual understanding of the processes and sociopolitical realities motivating the makers, users, and patrons of these musical “picture books.”

Art historical study of illuminated choir books traditionally seeks to identify the hands of individual masters, yet these books were the products of collaborators sharing resources and materials. Such collaborations are evident in a series of strikingly colorful dragons in choir books illuminated for the [monastery of San Isidoro del Campo](https://www.juntadeandalucia.es/cultura/enclaves/enclave-monumental-san-isidoro-del-campo) near Seville. From individual eyes to full heads and bodies, these dragons inhabit elaborately painted initials around historiated scenes depicting faraway lands. These dragons are also symbols of the choir book’s 15th-century patrons, the dukes of Medina Sidonia, plucked from the legend of their ancestor Guzmán el Bueno (Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, 1256–1309).
