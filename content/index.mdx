## About Ciiipreses

A collaborative project to reimagine the makers, users, and patrons of the late 15th-century choir books illuminated for San Isidoro del Campo (Santiponce, Spain).

Ciiipreses is built and conceptualized on [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) to present images of cuttings and leaves of illuminations from the original choir books.
