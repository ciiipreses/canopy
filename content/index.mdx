Ciiipreses seeks to reimagine the makers, users, and patrons of illuminated manuscripts in late medieval and early modern Seville.

The catalog of miniatures on vellum presented on this website is a work in progess, currently focused on choir books made for the monastery of San Isidoro del Campo. These illuminations survive from a series of choir books dispersed in the 19th century through the collections of William Stirling Maxwell and Frederick William Cosens. The proposed attributions and dates can be explored on the [works](/canopy/works) and [metadata](/canopy/metadata) pages.

Ciiipreses is built and conceptualized on [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) to support sustainable scholarly publishing and the reuse of research data and open access images.
