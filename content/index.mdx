## About Ciiipreses

A collaborative project to reimagine the makers, users, and patrons of the late 15th-century choir books illuminated for San Isidoro del Campo.

The catalog of miniatures on vellum presented on this website describe the surviving illuminations from a series of choir books dispersed in the 19th century through the collections of William Stirling Maxwell and Frederick William Cosens. Attributions and dates can be explored on the [works](/canopy/works) and [metadata](/canopy/metadata) pages.

Ciiipreses is built and conceptualized on [IIIF](https://iiif.io/) to support sustainable scholarly publishing and reuse of research data and open access images.
